# Zoid_hex
This is my hexapod robot, zoid4.2!

It walks, turns, stands, sits and is being awesome

It uses:
        MG996R servos
        Pololu Maestro 18 channel servo driver
        Arduino Uno as main controller
        3D printed PLA parts
        Bearings on each dof

Limitations:
        No gravity compensation
        No specific place for electronics, they are just tied to the thorax
        No sensors, moves by hard coding
